```

Then use the API to downlaod the data of interest:

```
import SoccerNet
from SoccerNet.Downloader import SoccerNetDownloader

mySoccerNetDownloader = SoccerNetDownloader(
    LocalDirectory="/path/to/SoccerNet")

# download labels SN v2
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["Labels-v2.json"], split=["train","valid","test"])
# download labels for camera shot
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["Labels-cameras.json"], split=["train","valid","test"]) 

# download Features reduced with PCA
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy", "2_ResNET_TF2_PCA512.npy"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])

```

If you want to download the videos, you will need to fill a NDA to get the password.

```
mySoccerNetDownloader.password = input("Password for videos?:\n")

# download LQ (224p) Videos
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_224p.mkv", "2_224p.mkv"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])

# download HQ (720p) Videos
mySoccerNetDownloader.downloadGames(files=["1_720p.mkv", "2_720p.mkv"], split=["train","valid","test","challenge"])
```
